### Fixes & improvements

- Control Plane: The polling interval for a branch deletion operation was decreased from approximately 20 seconds to 1 second. A branch deletion operation typically takes a few seconds but appeared to take longer due to the polling delay.
- UI: Fixed the code example copy button in the **Connection Details** widget, which failed to remain stationary while scrolling.
