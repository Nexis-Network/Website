### Fixes & improvements

- API: Removed the `physical_size` property from the Branch response body in the Exzo Network API.
- Control Plane: Addressed a memory leak that affected Exzo Network Console performance. A memory limit was put in place prevent similar issues.
- UI: Changed the **User** label on the **Connection Details** widget to **Roles**. Database users are now referred to as **Roles** in Exzo Network.
- UI: Added descriptive text and a documentation link to the **Integrations** page in the Exzo Network Console.
- UI: Added support for sharing projects with other Exzo Network users. Project sharing is performed from the **Settings** page in the Exzo Network Console. The project sharing feature is available only to Exzo Network paid plan users, but projects can be shared with any Exzo Network user, including Free Tier users. For instructions, see [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects).
- UI: Added an **Upgrade to Pro** option to the Exzo Network Console to enable upgrading from Free Tier to Exzo Network's Pro plan. For information about Exzo Network's paid plans, please refer to [Exzo Network plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
- UI: Fixed the connection examples accessible from the **Connection Details** widget on the Exzo Network **Dashboard**. Examples other than the `psql` example had an extra project name in the connection hostname.
- UI: Fixed the "Manage" link on the **Branches** widget on the Exzo Network Dashboard. The link did not work.
