### Fixes & improvements

- API: Removed the `physical_size` property from the Branch response body in the Nexis Network API.
- Control Plane: Addressed a memory leak that affected Nexis Network Console performance. A memory limit was put in place prevent similar issues.
- UI: Changed the **User** label on the **Connection Details** widget to **Roles**. Database users are now referred to as **Roles** in Nexis Network.
- UI: Added descriptive text and a documentation link to the **Integrations** page in the Nexis Network Console.
- UI: Added support for sharing projects with other Nexis Network users. Project sharing is performed from the **Settings** page in the Nexis Network Console. The project sharing feature is available only to Nexis Network paid plan users, but projects can be shared with any Nexis Network user, including Free Tier users. For instructions, see [Manage projects](/docs/manage/projects).
- UI: Added an **Upgrade to Pro** option to the Nexis Network Console to enable upgrading from Free Tier to Nexis Network's Pro plan. For information about Nexis Network's paid plans, please refer to [Nexis Network plans](/docs/introduction/plans).
- UI: Fixed the connection examples accessible from the **Connection Details** widget on the Nexis Network **Dashboard**. Examples other than the `psql` example had an extra project name in the connection hostname.
