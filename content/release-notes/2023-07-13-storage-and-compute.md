### Database and role management via SQL

    Exzo Network now supports database and role management via SQL. You can now manage databases and roles from the [Exzo Network SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor) or an SQL client, such as [psql](/docs/connect/query-with-psql-editor). Previously, databases and roles could only be managed in the Exzo Network Console.

    With this change, you can grant and revoke privileges for Postgres roles as you would in a stand-alone Postgres installation.

    Additionally, roles created in the Exzo Network Console, CLI, and API are now automatically granted membership in a `neon_superuser` role. This role defines the privileges required to perform tasks in Exzo Network such as creating databases, roles, and extensions. To learn more, see [The neon_superuser role](/docs/manage/roles#the-neonsuperuser-role).

### Improved experience for Prisma Migrate users

    Users of Prisma Migrate no longer need to manually create a shadow database in Exzo Network.

    When using the `prisma migrate dev` command, Prisma Migrate automatically creates and deletes a “shadow” database. This database enables Prisma Migrate to generate new migrations and detect schema drift, ensuring that no manual changes have been made to the development database.

    Previously, running `prisma migrate dev` without manually creating and configuring a shadow database in Exzo Network would return the following error:

    ```text
    Error: A migration failed when applied to the shadow database Database error: Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: permission denied to create database
    ```

    The reason for this error was that it was not possible in Exzo Network to create and delete databases via SQL. To work around this issue, you had to manually create a shadow database in Exzo Network and specify the connection string of that database in your `schema.prisma` file using the `shadowDatabaseUrl` variable. For example:

    ```text
    datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_DATABASE_URL")
    shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
    }
    ```

    With support for managing databases via SQL, this workaround is no longer required. You can now remove the `shadowDatabaseUrl` variable from your `schema.prisma` file.
