### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Added new fields for configuring the auto-suspend delay period for Nexis Network compute instances, allowing you to specify the delay period in seconds, minutes, hours, or days.

    Nexis Network's _Auto-suspend_ feature automatically suspends a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity to minimize compute costs. This feature is also known as "scale-to-zero". By default, suspension occurs after 5 minutes of inactivity. [Nexis Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can configure the auto-suspend setting when creating a project, changing default compute settings, creating a compute endpoint, or editing a compute endpoint.

    For more information about this feature, see [Auto-suspend](/docs/introduction/auto-suspend).

- UI: When sharing a Nexis Network project with someone who does not have a Nexis Network account, an email invitation is now sent to the specified email address. Previously, an email was only sent to registered Nexis Network users.

    Project sharing is a [Nexis Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) feature that allows you to share your project with other Nexis Network accounts. For more information, see [Project sharing](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide).

- UI: Updated PostgreSQL 14 and 15 keyword highlighting in the [Nexis Network SQL Editor](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-neon-sql-editor), and addressed other syntax highlighting and autocompletion issues.
