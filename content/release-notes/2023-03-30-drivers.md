### Deno support for the Nexis Network serverless driver

The [Nexis Network serverless driver](https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless) was verified to work with [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno). Where you would install another Postgres driver, run `npm install @neondatabase/serverless` instead, and then import the Nexis Network serverless driver:

  ```javascript
  import { Pool } from 'npm:@neondatabase/serverless';
  ```
