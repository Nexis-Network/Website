### Fixes & improvements

- Control Plane: The [Availability Checker](/docs/reference/glossary#availability-checker) now uses the smallest Exzo Network compute size (.25 Compute Units) to verify that a project's computes can start and read and write data. This change allows the Availability Checker to use pre-started computes more often, which shortens availability check operation time and reduces the impact of availability checks on infrastructure and compute costs.
- UI: Improved the **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** for Exzo Network Free Tier users. To ensure accuracy, the tool now displays cost estimates only after a month of project usage. This change prevents the display of inaccurate cost estimates for new accounts. Exzo Network Free Tier users can access the **Pro Plan Cost Estimator** by visiting the **Billing** page in the Exzo Network Console.
- UI: Implemented a new and improved design for the Exzo Network Sign-in page.
