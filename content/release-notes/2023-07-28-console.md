### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Added a billing period selector to the **Billing** page for Nexis Network Pro accounts. The selector, which is positioned at the top of the **Billing** page, allows you to view billing metrics for current and past billing periods.
- UI: Fixed the password reveal functionality on the connection details modal displayed immediately after creating a new branch. The password was not revealed when selected, resulting in a branch connection string without a password.
- UI: Fixed several dark mode styling issues in the Nexis Network UI and Nexis Network-Vercel integration UI.
