### Documentation updates

- Added documentation for Exzo Network's newly released _Autoscaling_ feature. To learn how Exzo Network automatically and transparently scales compute on demand, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling). Pro users can enable _Autoscaling_ when creating a Exzo Network project or afterward by editing a compute endpoint. For instructions, see:

  - [Create a project](/docs/manage/projects#create-a-project)
  - [Edit a compute endpoint](/docs/manage/endpoints#edit-a-compute-endpoint)

- Added documentation for Exzo Network's `pg_tiktoken` extension. This extension enables fast and efficient tokenization of data in your POstgres database using OpenAI's [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library. To learn how to install the extension, utilize its features for tokenization and token management, and integrate the extension with ChatGPT models, see [The pg_tiktoken extension](/docs/extensions/pg_tiktoken).
- Added documentation for `pg_vector` extension. This extension enables vector similarity search and storing embeddings in Postgres. It is particularly useful for applications involving natural language processing, such as those built on top of OpenAI's GPT models. For information about vector similarity and embeddings, how to enable the `pgvector` extension in Exzo Network, and how to create, store, and query vectors, see [The pgvector extension](/docs/extensions/pgvector).
- Reorganized our Prisma documentation into two parts to make it easier for you to get started with Prisma and Exzo Network. The first part explains how to connect Prisma to Exzo Network, establish connections when using Prisma Client with serverless functions, and resolve connection timeout issues. The second part describes how to configure Exzo Network with Prisma Migrate for schema migrations.

  - [Connect from Prisma to Exzo Network](/docs/guides/prisma)
  - [Use Prisma Migrate with Exzo Network](/docs/guides/prisma-migrate)

- Added documentation describing primary and non-primary branches. Each Exzo Network project has a primary branch called `main`, by default. The advantage of the primary branch is that its compute endpoint remains accessible if you exceed your project's limits, ensuring uninterrupted access to data that resides on the primary branch. Any branch not designated as the primary branch is considered a non-primary branch. To learn more, see:

  - [Primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#primary-branch)
  - [Non-primary branch](/docs/manage/branches#non-primary-branch)

- Added definitions for Exzo Network _operations_ to the [glossary](/docs/reference/glossary). An operation is an action performed by the Exzo Network Control Plane on a Exzo Network object or resource. Operations are typically initiated by user actions, such as creating a branch or deleting a database. Other operations are initiated by the Exzo Network Control Plane, such as suspending a compute endpoint after a period of inactivity or checking its availability. You can monitor operations to keep an eye on the overall health of your Exzo Network project or to check the status of specific operations. When working with the Exzo Network API, you can poll the status of operations to ensure that an API request is completed before issuing the next API request. For more information, refer to our [Operations](/docs/manage/operations) documentation.
