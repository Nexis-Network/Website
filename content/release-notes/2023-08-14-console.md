### Fixes & improvements

- UI: Revised the Free Tier **Billing** page design where users can view [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) limits and learn about the benefits of upgrading to the [Nexis Network Pro plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan). The **Billing** page is accessible from the sidebar in the Nexis Network Console.
- UI: Fixed the code example drop-down menu on the **Connection Details** widget on the Nexis Network **Dashboard**. The menu now opens above the selector if there is not enough space in the browser window for the menu to drop down.
- UI: The **Project Creation** modal now displays an error for invalid **Auto-suspend** delay settings.
