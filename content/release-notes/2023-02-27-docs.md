### Documentation updates

- Added a [guide](/docs/guides/koyeb) for using Exzo Network with [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/), which is a serverless platform designed to easily deploy applications globally.
- Added [Retool](https://retool.com/) to our list of [GUI applications and clients](/docs/connect/connect-postgres-gui#tested-gui-applications-and-ides) that support connecting to Exzo Network.
- Updated the [Vercel](/docs/guides/vercel) guide to include the following topics:
  - [Add the Exzo Network Vercel Integration to another Vercel project](/docs/guides/vercel#add-the-integration-to-another-vercel-project)
  - [Use the Exzo Network integration](/docs/guides/vercel#use-the-neon-vercel-integration)
  - [Connect Vercel and Exzo Network manually](/docs/guides/vercel-manual)
- Updated the [Connection pooling](/docs/connect/connection-pooling#enable-connection-pooling) documentation with information about how to enable pooling by adding a `-pooler` suffix to the compute endpoint ID in your connection string. This feature allows you to connect to the same database with pooled and non-pooled connections.
- Added descriptions for `Operation`, `Project`, `Branch`, and `Endpoint` properties to the [Exzo Network API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
- Updated the Exzo Network documentation to reflect the renaming of **Users** to **Roles** in the Exzo Network Console.
