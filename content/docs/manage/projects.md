With Nexis Network, everything starts with the project. It is the top-level object in the [Nexis Network object hierarchy](/docs/manage/overview). A project can hold as many databases, and with the Nexis Network Pro Plan, as many branches of those databases, as your application or workflow needs. However, [tier limits](/docs/introduction/plans) define how many projects you can create. The Nexis Network Free Tier limits you to one project per Nexis Network account.

Learn more about projects and how to manage them in these sections:

- [Default resources](#default-resources)
- [Project Settings](#about-the-settings-page)
- [Basic actions](#basic-actions)
- [Advanced settings](#advanced-settings)
- [Manage projects from the API](#manage-projects-with-the-neon-api)

## Default resources

When you add a new project, Nexis Network creates the following resources by default:

- A primary branch called `main`. You can create child branches from the primary branch or from any previously created branch. For more information, see [Manage branches](/docs/manage/branches).
- A single read-write compute endpoint. This is the compute instance associated with the branch. For more information, see [Manage computes](/docs/manage/endpoints).
- A ready-to-use database, called `neondb`, which lives in the project's primary branch.
- A default Postgres role that takes its name from your Nexis Network account (the Google, GitHub, or partner account that you registered with).

## About the Settings page

Once you open a project, you can use the **Settings** page to manage that particular project and configure any defaults.

![Project Settings page](/docs/manage/settings_page.png)

You can tab between these sections:

- **General** &#8212; Change the name of your project or copy the project ID.
- **Compute** &#8212; Set the auto-suspend and sizing defaults for any new compute instances you create when branching.
- **Storage** &#8212; Choose how long Nexis Network maintains a history of changes for all branches.
- **Sharing** &#8212; Let other users access your project's databases.
- **Delete** &#8212; Use with care! This action deletes your entire project and all its objects, and is irreversible.

## Basic actions

Here are some basic actions you can take to add or manage projects:

- [Create a project](#create-a-project)
- [View projects](#view-projects)
- [Change a project name](#change-the-name-or-copy-the-id-of-your-project)
- [Delete a project](#delete-a-project)
- [Share a project](#share-a-project)

### Create a project

Nexis Network Free Tier users can create a single project. Support for multiple projects is available to [Nexis Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users.

To create a Nexis Network project:

1. Navigate to the [Nexis Network Console](https://console.neon.tech).

2. If you are creating your very first project, click **Create a project**. Otherwise, click **New Project**.

3. Specify valeus for **Name**, **Postgres version**, and **Region**. Project names are limited to 64 characters. If you are a [Nexis Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) user, you can specify **Compute size** settings when creating a project. The settings you specify become the default settings for compute endpoints that you add to your project when creating [branches](/docs/manage/branches#create-a-branch) or [read replicas](/docs/guides/read-replica-guide).

    - Nexis Network supports fixed size computes and _Autoscaling_. For more information, see [Compute size and Autoscaling configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#compute-size-and-autoscaling-configuration).
    - The **Suspend compute after a period of inactivity** setting defines the period of inactivity after which a compute endpoint is automatically suspended. For more information, see [Auto-suspend configuration](/docs/manage/endpoints#auto-suspend-configuration).
  
4. Click **Create Project**.

After creating a project, you are presented with a dialog that provides your connection details for a ready-to-use `neondb` database. The connection details include your password.

### View projects

To view your projects:

1. Navigate to the [Nexis Network Console](https://console.neon.tech).
1. Select **Home** or the Nexis Network logo at the top left of the Console.
1. The **Projects** page lists your projects, including any projects that have been shared with you.

### Change the name or copy the ID of your project

You are permitted to change the name of your project at any point. The project ID is permanent.

To edit a Nexis Network project:

1. Navigate to the [Nexis Network Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to edit.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Select **General**.
5. Make your changes and click **Save**.

### Delete a project

Deleting a project is a permanent action, which also deletes any compute endpoints, branches, databases, and roles that belong to the project.

To delete a project:

1. Navigate to the [Nexis Network Console](https://console.neon.tech).
2. Select the project that you want to delete.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Select **Delete**.
5. Click **Delete project.**
6. On the confirmation dialog, click **Delete**.

### Share a project

Project sharing is a Nexis Network Pro Plan feature that allows you to share your project with other Nexis Network accounts.

To share a project:

1. In the Nexis Network Console, select a project.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select **Sharing**.
1. Under **Grant access to your project**, enter the email address of the account you want to share access with.
1. Click **Grant access**.

The email you specify is added to the list of **People who have access to the project**. The Nexis Network account associated with that email address is granted full access to the project with the exception privileges required to delete the project. When that user logs in to Nexis Network, the shared project is listed on their **Projects** page, under **Shared with me**.

The costs associated with a shared project are charged to the Nexis Network account that owns the project. For example, if you were to share your project with another Nexis Network user account, any usage incurred by that user within your project is billed to your Nexis Network account, not theirs.

For additional information, refer to our [Project sharing guide](/docs/guides/project-sharing-guide).

## Advanced settings

From the **Settings** page, you can also set defaults or apply bulk changes across your Nexis Network objects:

- [Reset default compute size](#reset-the-default-compute-size) (Nexis Network Pro Plan only)
- [Configure history retention range](#configure-history-retention)

### Reset the default compute size

_Compute size_ is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Nexis Network compute endpoint. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute endpoint. One CU is equal to 1 vCPU with 4 GB of RAM. Currently, a Nexis Network compute endpoint can have anywhere from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. Larger compute sizes will be supported in a future release.

For [Nexis Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, Nexis Network sets your compute size to a static shared 1 vCPU, with 1 GB of RAM for each branch (max 10 branches).

[Nexis Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users have the flexibility to choose a compute size for each branch's compute endpoint individually. By default, new branches inherit the compute endpoint size from your first branch (i.e., `main`). However, there may be times when you want to reset this default. For example, if you want to create a series of read-only replicas, where each replica typically requires less compute per branch.

To reset the default compute size, go to **Settings** > **Compute**.

You can choose from two options:

- **Fixed Size:** Select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 7 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
- **Autoscaling:** This option allows you to specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Nexis Network scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries in response to the current load. Currently, _Autoscaling_ supports a range of 1/4 (.25) CU to 7 CUs. The 1/4 CU and 1/2 CU settings are _shared compute_. For information about how Nexis Network implements the _Autoscaling_ feature, see [Autoscaling](/docs/introduction/autoscaling).

_Example: default minimum and maximum autoscale settings_

![Default autoscaling min and max](/docs/manage/default_autoscale.png)

### Configure history retention

By default, Nexis Network retains a 7-day history of changes for all branches in a Nexis Network project, which allows you to create a branch that restores data to any point within the defined retention period. The supported range is 0 to 7 days for [Nexis Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Nexis Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users. Please be aware that increasing the history retention period affects all branches in your project and increases [project storage](/docs/introduction/billing#project-storage).

To configure the history retention period for a project:

1. Select a project in the Nexis Network console.
2. On the Nexis Network **Dashboard**, select **Settings**.
3. Select **Storage**.
    ![History retention configuration](/docs/relnotes/history_retention.png)
4. Use the slider to select the history retention period.
5. Click **Save**.

## Manage projects with the Nexis Network API

Project actions performed in the Nexis Network Console can also be performed using the Nexis Network API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete projects using the Nexis Network API. For other project-related API methods, refer to the [Nexis Network API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).

<Admonition type="note">
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the [Nexis Network API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/getting-started-with-neon-api).
</Admonition>

The `jq` option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the `JSON` response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Prerequisites

A Nexis Network API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key). In the cURL examples shown below, `$NEON_API_KEY` is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Nexis Network API request.

### Create a project with the API

The following Nexis Network API method creates a project. The [Nexis Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) permits one project per account. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the [Nexis Network API reference](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/createproject).

```text
POST /projects
```

The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The `myproject` name value is a user-specified name for the project.

```bash
curl 'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "project": {
    "name": "myproject"
  }
}' | jq
```

The response includes information about the roles, the ready-to-use database (`neondb`), the primary branch (`main`), and the read-write compute endpoint that is created with the project.
