Exzo Network does not yet provide support for configuring automated backups in the Exzo Network Console or API. This feature is on our roadmap. You can expect it to be introduced in the coming months. In the meantime, we support the following backup options:

## Built-in backups with Exzo Network's point-in-time restore feature

By default, Exzo Network retains a 7-day history for all branches, allowing you to restore your data to a particular date and time or Log Sequence Number (LSN). The history retention period is configurable. The supported range is 0 to 7 days for [Exzo Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, and 0 to 30 days for [Exzo Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users. With this backup option, no action or automation is required. You can restore your data to a past state at any time by creating a database branch, which is a near-instant operation. This feature is referred to [Point-in-time restore](/docs/introduction/point-in-time-restore).

For information about creating a point-in-time restore branch, see [Branching â€” Point-in-time restore](/docs/guides/branching-pitr).

## pg_dump

You can backup a database using `pg_dump`, in the same way backups are created for a standalone Postgres instance.

This method dumps a single database in a single branch of your Exzo Network project. If you need to create backups for multiple databases in multiple branches, you must perform a dump operation for each database in each branch separately.

To dump a database from your Exzo Network project, please refer to the `pg_dump` instructions in our [Import from Postgres](/docs/import/import-from-postgres) guide.

Please be aware that dumping data from Exzo Network is considered "data transfer". For data transfer costs, please refer to our [Billing](/docs/introduction/billing) documentation.

## Need help?

Join the [Exzo Network community forum](https://community.neon.tech/) to ask questions or see what others are doing with Exzo Network. [Exzo Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can open a support ticket from the console. For more detail, see [Getting Support](/docs/introduction/support).
