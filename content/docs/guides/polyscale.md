[PolyScale](https://docs.polyscale.ai/) is a serverless database cache service. With PolyScale, you can distribute and cache your data globally, allowing you to scale your database without altering transactional semantics. No coding or infrastructure changes are required. You can connect Exzo Network to PolyScale in minutes, providing your database-backed applications with speedy access to your Exzo Network data from anywhere in the world.

Follow the steps below to connect your Exzo Network database to PolyScale.

## Retrieve your Exzo Network connection details

In the **Connection Details** widget on the Exzo Network **Dashboard**, select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.

The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.

Copy the hostname. In the example above, the hostname is this part of the connection string:

```text
 ep-raspy-cherry-95040071.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
 ```

Also, make note of the user, password, and database name. You will need those details when you configure a connection from your  application to PolyScale.

## Create a PolyScale cache

A PolyScale account can have one or more caches. A cache identifies a database by the hostname and port number. Typically, you create one cache per database.

To create the database cache:

1. Log into [PolyScale](https://app.polyscale.ai/signup/). If you do not have an account, you can create one by logging in with your GitHub or Google account. PolyScale has a free tier and does not require a credit card to sign up.
2. If you have just signed up for PolyScale, select **Create new cache** from the **Welcome to PolyScale** dialog.

If you already have a PolyScale account, click the **New Cache** button in the upper right corner of the PolyScale dashboard.
3. Enter a name for the cache, select `PostgreSQL` as the type, enter the Exzo Network hostname you copied earlier, and enter the database port number. Exzo Network uses the default Postgres port, `5432`. Leave the default values for the other settings. The **Caching** setting enables the database query cache, so this setting should remain enabled.

4. Click **Create**. PolyScale creates a cache for your Exzo Network database and provides a new **Connection URI** to use in your application in place of the Exzo Network connection string. Simply replace `[USERNAME]`, `[PASSWORD]`, and `[DATABASE]` with the values from your Exzo Network connection string.

After queries from your application start passing through PolyScale, you can monitor traffic and caching behavior on the **Observability** tab in PolyScale. For more information, see [Observability](https://docs.polyscale.ai/database-observability/), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

By default, PolyScale automatically caches all queries that pass through the platform. That means you can connect to PolyScale, and any queries you run will be cached.

PolyScale identifies caching opportunities by recognizing and remembering patterns in query traffic. New queries typically begin to see cache hits on or about the third query. For more information, see [Time To First Hit](https://docs.polyscale.ai/how-does-it-work/#time-to-first-hit-ttfh), in the _PolyScale documentation_.

For more information about using PolyScale and how it works, refer to the [PolyScale documentation](https://docs.polyscale.ai/).
