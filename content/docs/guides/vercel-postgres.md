[Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage) is a collection of managed storage products that you can integrate with your frontend framework. Included in this suite of products is [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres), which is serverless Postgres **powered by Nexis Network**.

Vercel Postgres is currently available in [Beta](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/release-phases#beta) on Vercel's [Pro and Hobby plans](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/payments-and-billing/pro).

With _Vercel Postgres_, creating, deleting, and managing a Postgres instance happens in the Vercel dashboard rather than the Nexis Network Console or using the Nexis Network API. Furthermore, you do not need a Nexis Network account to use Vercel Postgres. Everything is managed from Vercel.

Vercel Postgres is an alternative to using Nexis Network directly through one of the other Vercel integration options described in the [Nexis Network and Vercel integration overview](/docs/guides/vercel-overview).

Use the following resources to get started with Vercel Postgres:

- Follow the [Vercel Postgres Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart) to learn how to read and write data from Vercel Postgres.
