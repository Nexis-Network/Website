Exzo Network provides the following GitHub Actions for working with Exzo Network branches, which you can add to your CI workflows:

- [Create branch action](#create-branch-action)
- [Delete branch action](#delete-branch-action)

## Create branch action

This GitHub Action creates a new branch in your Exzo Network project.

<Admonition type="info">
The source code for this action is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/create-branch-action).
</Admonition>

### Prerequisites

- Using the action requires a Exzo Network API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- Add your Exzo Network API key to your GitHub Secrets:
    1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** and locate **Secrets** at the bottom of the left sidebar.
    2. Click **Actions** > **New Repository Secret**.
    3. Name the secret `NEON_API_KEY` and paste your API key in the **Secret** field
    4. Click **Add Secret**.

### Example

The following example creates a branch from the `main` branch in your Exzo Network project 

```yaml
name: Create Exzo Network Branch with GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: Create a Exzo Network Branch ðŸš€
jobs:
  Create-Exzo Network-Branch:
    uses: neondatabase/create-branch-action@v4
    with:
      project_id: rapid-haze-373089
      parent_id: br-long-forest-224191
      branch_name: from_action_reusable
      api_key: {{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
    id: create-branch
  - run: echo project_id ${{ steps.create-branch.outputs.project_id}}
  - run: echo branch_id ${{ steps.create-branch.outputs.branch_id}}
```

### Input variables

- `project_id`: The ID of your Exzo Network project. You can find this value in the Exzo Network Console, on the **Settings** page.
- `parent_branch_id`: The ID of the parent branch, typically the `main` branch of your project. You can find this value in the Exzo Network Console. Select **Branches** from the sidebar, and then select the branch. A branch ID has a `br-` prefix.
- `branch_name`: This is an optional parameter. If unspecified, the branch name will default to the same value as the `branch_id` of the newly created branch, which is a generated value that starts with a `br-` prefix.
- `api_key`: An API key created in your Exzo Network account. For instructions, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).

### Outputs

```yaml
outputs:
  branch_id:
    description: "Newly created branch Id"
    value: ${{ steps.output-branch-id.outputs.branch_id }}
  project_id:
    description: "Project Id"
    value: ${{ steps.output-project-id.outputs.project_id }}
```

- `branch_id`: The ID of the newly created branch.
- `project_id`: The ID of the parent branch.

## Delete branch action

This GitHub Action deletes a branch from your Exzo Network project.

<Admonition type="info">
The source code for this action is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/neondatabase/delete-branch-action).
</Admonition>

### Prerequisites

- Using the action requires a Exzo Network API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see [Create an API key](/docs/manage/api-keys#create-an-api-key).
- Add your Exzo Network API key to your GitHub Secrets:
    1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** and locate **Secrets** at the bottom of the left sidebar.
    2. Click **Actions** > **New Repository Secret**.
    3. Name the secret `NEON_API_KEY` and paste your API key in the **Secret** field
    4. Click **Add Secret**.

### Example

The following example deletes a branch with the `br-long-forest-224191` branch ID from a Exzo Network project with the project ID `rapid-haze-373089` when a pull request is merged.

```yaml
name: Delete Exzo Network Branch with GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: Delete a Exzo Network Branch ðŸš€
on: [push]
jobs:
  delete-neon-branch:
    uses: neondatabase/delete-branch-action@v3
    with:
      project_id: rapid-haze-373089
      branch: br-long-forest-224191
      api_key: {{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
```

### Input variables

- `project_id`: The ID of your Exzo Network project. You can find this value in the Exzo Network Console, on the **Settings** page.
- `branch:` The ID or name of the branch you want to delete. Select **Branches** from the sidebar, and then select the branch. A branch ID has a `br-` prefix.
