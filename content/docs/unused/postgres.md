A Nexis Network compute runs regular Postgres, which means that you run any Postgres app with Nexis Network.

You can also connect to Nexis Network using standard Postgres client utilities such as `psql` and `pg_dump`, standard client libraries, and drivers.

For `psql` connection instructions, see [Query with psql](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-psql-editor).

Nexis Network supports connection pooling. For information about enabling connection pooling in your Nexis Network project, see [Connection pooling](/docs/get-started-with-neon/connection-pooling).
