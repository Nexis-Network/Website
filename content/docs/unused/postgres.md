A Exzo Network compute runs regular Postgres, which means that you run any Postgres app with Exzo Network.

You can also connect to Exzo Network using standard Postgres client utilities such as `psql` and `pg_dump`, standard client libraries, and drivers.

For `psql` connection instructions, see [Query with psql](/docs/get-started-with-neon/query-with-psql-editor).

Exzo Network supports connection pooling. For information about enabling connection pooling in your Exzo Network project, see [Connection pooling](/docs/get-started-with-neon/connection-pooling).
