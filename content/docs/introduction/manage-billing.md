A Exzo Network account subscribed to a paid plan can manage billing from the **Billing** page in the Exzo Network Console. On the **Billing** page, you can:

- View charges for the current month
- Update your billing email
- Update your payment method
- View and download invoices
- Downgrade your plan

For Exzo Network Free Tier accounts, the **Billing** page allows users to view [Exzo Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) usage limits, learn about [Exzo Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) features, and estimate monthly Exzo Network Pro Plan cost based on your current usage.

## View the billing page

1. Navigate to the Exzo Network Console.
1. Select **Billing** from the sidebar.

### Missed payments

If an auto-debit payment transaction fails, Exzo Network sends a request to update your payment method. There is a grace period for missed payments followed by a delinquency period. Late fees and payment policies are described in Exzo Networkâ€™s [Terms of Service](https://neon.tech/terms-of-service).

## Invoices

A Exzo Network invoice includes an **Amount due** for the billing period and a cost breakdown by project and [billing metric](/docs/introduction/billing).

### Download invoices

To download an invoice:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Exzo Network Console.
1. Under **Latest invoices**, locate the invoice you want to download and click the PDF download icon.

## Downgrade your plan

To downgrade from the Exzo Network Pro Plan to the Exzo Network Free Tier:

1. Navigate to the **Billing** page in the Exzo Network Console.
1. Click **Downgrade plan** at the bottom of the page.
1. Follow the instructions on the **Downgrade** modal, and click **Downgrade**.

Downgrading from the Exzo Network Pro Plan transitions your account to the Exzo Network Free Tier, which has lower usage limits that may affect the performance of your applications. To compare plan limits, see [Exzo Network plans](/docs/introduction/plans#neon-plans).

You will be required to remove any projects, branches, or data that exceed [Exzo Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) limits. The downgrade goes into effect within 30 minutes. You will receive your final bill at the beginning of the next billing period (the start of the month following the downgrade).

To downgrade from Enterprise or Platform Partnership plans, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales). Cancellation of these plans is handled in accordance with the Master Subscription Agreement (MSA) outlined in the customer agreement.
