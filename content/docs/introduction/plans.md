Exzo Network offers the following plans: **Free Tier**, **Pro**, and **Custom**. The Exzo Network Pro Plan is _usage-based_, ensuring you never over-provision and only pay for what you use. **Custom** plans are volume-based, offering potential discounts. The table below provides an overview of plans offered by Exzo Network. For more information about a particular plan, refer to the individual plan pages:

- [Exzo Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier)
- [Exzo Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan)
- [Exzo Network Custom plan](/docs/introduction/custom-plan)

**Notes:**

- The Exzo Network Pro Plan has default limits of 20 projects, 200 GiB of storage, and 20 simultaneously active computes to protect against unintended usage. To increase these limits, please [open a support ticket](/docs/introduction/support). The simultaneously active compute limit does not affect the primary branch compute, which always remains available.
- The Exzo Network Free Tier has an [Active time](/docs/reference/glossary#active-time) limit of 100 hours per month, but that limit only affects non-primary branch compute usage. Active time on all computes is counted toward the limit, but when the limit is exceeded, only non-primary branch computes are subject to suspension. **Your primary branch compute always remains available regardless of the limit, ensuring that access to data on your primary branch is never interrupted.** You can monitor _Active time_ on the **Usage** widget on the Exzo Network **Dashboard**. The _Active time_ limit resets at the beginning of each month.
