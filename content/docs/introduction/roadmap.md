The Nexis Network **Limited Preview** started in February, 2022, and was made available to a small number of select users and friends.

On June 15th, 2022, the Nexis Network team announced the [Technical Preview](#technical-preview), making Nexis Network available to a wider audience. Thousands of users were able to try Nexis Network's [Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier).

On December 6th, 2022, Nexis Network released its branching feature and dropped the invite gate, welcoming everyone to try Nexis Network's Free Tier.

On March 15th, 2023, Nexis Network launched paid plans, providing increased limits and added features, including _Project sharing_ and _Autoscaling_. For information about Nexis Network's paid  plans, refer to our [Pricing](https://neon.tech/pricing) page.

Support for more regions and additional features will be released in the coming months.

## Technical Preview

Nexis Network sets a high standard for what constitutes a feature-complete product, meaning that all intended core functionality is implemented and operates as expected. While many features may be operational today, there may still be some that are under development or refinement. Nexis Network will remain in Technical Preview while the remaining features are still being developed and perfected.
