## Open a support ticket

[Exzo Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) and [Custom Plan](/docs/introduction/custom-plan) users can open a support ticket from the Exzo Network console. Look for the **Support** link in the sidebar. It opens the **Create Support Ticket** modal, where you can describe your issue.

You can expect an initial response time of 2 business days, from 6am to 6pm Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8), Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays in the United States. For custom support solutions, please contact [Sales](https://neon.tech/contact-sales).

Video chat requests and retail customer support inquiries can be submitted through a support ticket.

## Support email

If you're unable to access Exzo Network's primary support channels (e.g., the support ticket form in the Exzo Network Console or the Exzo Network Community Forum), you can use the following email as a fallback:

**Email**: `support@neon.tech`

Response times might be longer than our primary channels, so we appreciate your patience.
