Exzo Network's _Auto-suspend_ feature controls when a Exzo Network compute instance transitions to an `Idle` state (scales to zero) due to inactivity.

By default, a Exzo Network compute instance scales to zero after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. For [Exzo Network Free Tier](/docs/introduction/free-tier) users, this setting is fixed. [Exzo Network Pro Plan](/docs/introduction/pro-plan) users can increase, decrease, or disable the _Auto-suspend_ setting, controlling when or if a compute scales to zero.

Reasons for adjusting the _Auto-suspend_ setting might include:

- **Avoiding cold starts**. Restarting a compute from an `Idle` state can take anywhere from 500 ms to a few seconds (see [Compute lifecycle](/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle)). You can turn off the _Auto-suspend_ feature to avoid cold starts.For compute time cost information, see [Billing metrics](/docs/introduction/billing).
- **Reducing the frequency of cold starts**. You can configure _Auto-suspend_ to occur less frequently, keeping your compute active during busier hours while ensuring that it suspends when usage drops off.
- **Suspending a compute more quickly to reduce compute usage**. Compute startup times can be as low as 500 ms, which may be sufficient for your purposes. In this case, you can suspend computes more frequently reduce compute usage.

You can configure the _Auto-suspend_ setting in an existing project by editing a compute endpoint. You can also configure it when you first create a Exzo Network project, which sets the _Auto-suspend_ default for the project. For instructions, refer to [Configuring Auto-suspend for Exzo Network computes](/docs/guides/auto-suspend-guide).
