Exzo Network has successfully completed a SOC 2 Type 1 audit. A SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) Type 1 report is an attestation by an independent auditing entity, acknowledging that an organization has processes and systems in place that comply with the principles of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

This audit report focuses on five trust service criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Our successful completion of this audit signifies that our design of systems and procedures, as of a specific date, meet these stringent criteria.

Please note that while the term "SOC 2 Certified" is commonly used, it is not accurate and we refrain from using it. The AICPA explicitly advises against using this term. A SOC 2 report is an attestation of the effectiveness of controls, not a certification.

Our SOC 2 Type 1 report underscores our ongoing commitment to safeguarding customer data and maintaining a high level of security. We will continue to invest in regular audits and adhere to industry best practices to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the data you entrust us with.
